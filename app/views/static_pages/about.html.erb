<h2>What is brunch?</h2>

<p>
Brunch is the perfect meal in the time between breakfast and lunch (or whenever you wake
up tbh), usually taken on the weekends with friends and mimosas. Brunch has a
long, illustrious history in the United States, having served as the focal
point of weekend boozing and dining since the 1930s.
